This project is will find a white ball in a picture or video using OpenCV. The image files were tested with the ballimage.jpg and the video was captured with a webcam. A golf ball was used because that was all I had. Better results would be achieved with a colored ball. The details for files are below:

findballinimage.py - Finds a white ball in image. Shows only final result

findballinimage_detailed.py - Shows each step in finding a ball in the image. Shows all image transformations

findballinvideo.py - Finds a white ball in a video from a webcam. Shows only final result

findballinvideo_detailed.py - Shows each step in finding a ball in the video. Shows all image transformations

The test files were files I played around with when I was trying to learn what the OpenCV functions do. Feel free to try them out but they are not needed to run the ball tracker
